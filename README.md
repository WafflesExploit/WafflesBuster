# WafflesBuster
### -> A simple Multi-threaded directory buster. 

I created this script, to directory bust a website and when '429' code is returned pause the script. '429' was the code a website was giving out when it blocked my IP.
This way, I could change my IP address with a VPN, before unpausing the script.

### Running normally
